## Overview

This project is a simple **QR code component** built using **HTML and CSS**.  
The goal was to recreate a clean and responsive card layout that matches the design provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It displays a QR code that, when scanned, leads users to the Frontend Mentor website.  
The challenge focuses on practicing layout skills (centering, spacing, font styling) and learning how to make content responsive for both **mobile (375px)** and **desktop (1440px)** screens.

  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
